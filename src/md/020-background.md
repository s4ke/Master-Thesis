# Background

\label{sec:background}

Before we delve into our novel approach for parallel programming using
Arrows, we give a short overview of all our main concepts and technologies.
We start with an introduction to functional programming (Chapter \ref{sec:fuproHaskell})
including a short tutorial on Monads (Chapter \ref{sec:monads}) as well as
an introduction to Arrows (Chapter \ref{sec:arrows}). Finally, we give a short introduction to the main parallel
Haskells that are used as backends for our DSL in this thesis (Chapter \ref{sec:parallelHaskells}) - GpH, the `Par` Monad, and
Eden.
