# Further development of Parallel Arrows

\label{sec:further-development}

With the basic PArrows API in place, we will develop the API
even further in this chapter. In Chapter \ref{sec:futures} we introduce the concept of Futures
that allows for direct inter-process communication. Then, in Chapter
\ref{sec:topology-skeletons} we use this concept to define more sophisticated topological skeletons,
namely a `pipe`, a `ring` and a `torus`.
